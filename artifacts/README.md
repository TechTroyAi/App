### Install on Android

1. Copy `Blockhold-Defense-v1.2-installable.apk` to the phone (download, USB, Drive, etc.).
2. Open the file and allow **Install unknown apps** for your file manager/browser if prompted.
3. Tap Install.

**Note:** This uses a **sideload/debug key**, not the permanent v1.0 production release key (which is not present in this workspace). If you already have production `ai.techtroy.blockhold` installed from the v1.0 release APK, uninstall that first — Android will reject an update signed with a different key.

## F2 Named threats (this build)

- Elites: **Grave Mender**, **Pyre Wight**
- Bosses: **Iron Monarch**, **Spore Sovereign** (plus Overgrowth)
- Wind-up tells + banner stings on ability charge / spawn
- Alias also at `Blockhold-Defense-v1.2-f2-installable.apk`

## v1.2 Forgeworks signing input

`Blockhold-Defense-v1.2-unsigned.apk` is the rebuilt v1.2 Forgeworks + 1.3 content payload before signing (from the latest apktool rebuild).

- APK SHA-256: `ca4356610999b284103674c166ed65d3bcf2981684cc7a17bb0650c11c399b47`
- Signing state: **unsigned** (cannot install until signed)

For a production update compatible with existing v1.0 installs, re-sign the unsigned APK with the permanent Blockhold Defense key. See `docs/VERIFICATION.md` and `docs/SIGNING.md`.

The dedicated private signing material is excluded from Git. Restore `Blockhold-Defense-signing-backup.zip` only through the secure workspace attachment flow and keep it outside version control.

## First playable archive

`Blockhold-Defense-v0.1-debug.apk` is retained as the original five-wave vertical slice under the old prototype package `ai.techtroy.app`. It installs independently from Blockhold Defense.
